            This is meant to be a guide about how to deal with other developers, other students in the "real world", and to remind you that you will always be a student. Programming means never giving up learning, never stopping growth.

          <h2>While you're here</h2>
          <p>
            Ask questions during lectures - you aren't holding up the class. Asking things causes us to explain it more throughly - and you'll get <span class="tt" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Literal points - for your house/team/army.">points</span> for doing it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Ask questions of yourself, and your code. If you don't know what a statement does, or how a function works, make sure you ask someone. The important thing is to make sure you understand what you're doing. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Ask questions while working - you'll pair for a large part of the program, and hopefully you'll pair for some of the other time you're here. You'll also pair frequently with your mentor - tell everyone you work with your thinking process, and how you got the code you did. Remember that understanding is a process, aided by asking. Remember that <em>asking doesn't mean you don't know something - it means you're about to.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer questions - If you think you know the answer, mention it. This helps you to understand concepts better. It also enforces that you actually know something, rather than not being clear on it.
          </p>
          <p>Speak up - for yourself, and for others.</p>
          <p> 
            Correct people when they make conceptual mistakes, but not when they make minor errors. One of the biggest things we teach people here is confidence. Corrections mostly point out wrongness, without adding much information. When someone makes many errors, write it up as feedback, but don't point things out while they're talking. Make sure your correction actually helps someone learn, instead of showing off what you know.
          </p>
          <p>Share knowledge. If you learn something, teach it to someone else. This helps you learn it better.</p>
          <p>Say "I don't know" at least once a day; solve your own "I don't know", at least once a day.</p>
          <p>Ask for things you want, don't wait for someone to realize you need something.</p>

          <h2>In The Real World</h2>
          <p>Joining Hackbright means joining a community of programmers who help each other. That community intersects with the outside world, and here are the things you should do to help yourself, and help your community thrive. Make sure you've checked off these tasks to help be more visible as a developer.</p>

        <p>These are some actual rules. Some are security policies, some are so that we don't have to send emails to the group telling everyone to pick up their trash. Mostly, just try to be respectful of the space. If we notice you not following these rules, you'll lose points for your group.</p>

          <h2>Kitchen</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Things not labeled in the fridge are Free Food. Please eat it.</li>
            <li>Things without a date on them in the fridge will be thrown out on Fridays. Things with a date will be thrown out if they are older than 5 days old.</li>
            <li>If you use the kitchen, or dishes, clean up after yourself. Don't leave things in the sink for other people to clean.</li>
            <li>We don't have a cleaning staff. If you leave a mess, you're asking students and staff to clean it up for you.</li>

            <li>We're an engineering school, please treat our network as "hostile". Students are apt to "experiment" with "security techniques". We aren't responsible for anything that happens to your system on our network, but please ask us if you need help securing your system.</li>
            <li>If you are an experienced engineer, please answer questions if asked, and be encouraging. <em>Any</em> <span class="tt" data-toggle="tooltip" title=" Denigration (adj.) : 1.

          <h2>Health</h2>
          <p>
            These are things people tend to forget about during Hackbright, and we mean them very seriously. You can't be a great programmer without taking care of yourself.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep. Seriously, you can't not sleep.</li>
            <li>Eat. Real food - make yourself something, or eat some Free Food from the fridge.</li>
            <li>Drink Water. Don't drink soda, don't drink tea or coffee until you've had at least one cup of water. Keep track of it somewhere. Get half your body weight(in lbs) in ounces, per day.</li>
            <li>Caffeine is your friend, but it's not liquid sleep. Seriously, go to sleep.</li>
            <li>If you're sick, don't come in. Be actually sick though, not just overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>If you're overwhelmed, talk to us. We are experts at helping with this feeling, and we want you to get through this.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Time</h2>
          <p>
            Here's how to best use your time here.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep at night.</li>
            <li>Instructors are here from 10AM to roughly 8PM. If you need help, work with us during that time. Naps during the day might be helpful to you, but you have limited, and expensive, time to get seriously productive 1-on-1 help.</li>
            <li>Pick a project you enjoy working on. Something you'd like to see done, or something you've always wanted to understand. Don't worry if it's useful, or interesting to anyone but you. This is a time to explore what you do and don't like about programming.</li>
            <li>Use your mentor. They've signed up to help someone, and they get benefits by just affiliating themselves with Hackbright. Use their skills and knowledge to understand things.</li>
            <li>Understand your editor. Vim can be really useful, but so can Sublime Text and other IDEs. Pick a tool, then get good at that tool.</li>
            <li>Cheatsheets are something you're going to want to create. No one expects you to memorize anything, and you're wasting time by trying.</li>
            <li>If you get stuck, ask for help. If you aren't making progress because you don't understand, then ask.</li>
            <li>Don't copy-paste and walk away. Programming isn't fire and forget - you need to understand what's going on. If you complete an exercise and you can't explain how you did it, find an instructor.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Attendance</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Each day is crucial. We don't have an official attendance policy, but as we're investing a great deal of time and energy into you, we need you to be as serious about Hackbright as possible. Missing days for nonemergencies isn't acceptable.</li>
            <li>Being late for lecture means you'd better come armed with a programming joke.</li>
            <li>If you need to be late or absent for appointments, please give us as much advance notice as you can.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, you'll get sick. It's fine. If you're really sick, let us know and we'll try to give you some reading material, or some exercises to do. Missing a day means you're leaving someone without a partner however, so please try to be here!</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <a name="program"></a>
        <h1>The Program</h1>
        <h2>Lectures</h2>
        <p>Lectures are casual talks with the class about what's going to happen next, and a chance to ask the lead instructors to explain things we've recently done, or go over things more in depth. These lectures cover computer science, math, physics, programming culture, general geekery, and a great deal of humor. They're also heavy on the audience participation - make jokes, ask questions, send us on tangents. "War Stories" are how most programmers learn, so you'll get a great deal of those.</p>
        <p>Later in the program, you're going to be giving at least one tech talk. Have the topic cleared with <a href="mailto:cynthia@hackbrightacademy.com">Cynthia</a> before you start writing it. They should be 10 minutes in length, and should include slides, or a demo. Past talks are located in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3VGDBHeHluzLUhGZ21XUVVxOEk&usp=sharing">Tech Talks folder</a>. You may choose a topic that's been done before - but you have to make your own slide deck. The process of learning enough to write a talk is what's important here, plus teaching someone else's slide deck is not very easy, nor is it good practice.</p>
        <p>Lectures are at 10:00 and 2:00, as well as mini-lectures throughout the day. They occur in the lecture hall, either at the board, on the projector, or at tables. It's up to you to make sure you don't miss them.</p>
        <h2>Pairing</h2>
        <p>For the first half of class, you'll be pairing. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. This helps you learn, helps you not get stuck for too long, keeps you from checking facebook or your email. It's also great for the other person, for the same reason. You might feel like you're being slowed down - think of it more as being through. You might feel like you're slowing someone else down - think of it as making sure they're being rigorous about their own understanding. </p>
        <p>The room tends to get loud - try to limit the volume of your own voice, but we understand when you get excited! Also, because the room gets loud, it can overwhelm you, or your partner. <strong>If you feel the need to take a break because of the noise, or because you're overwhelmed, there is quiet space for meditation and focus.</strong> First, make sure your partner knows you need a break due to the noise. Next, let them know a time when you'll be coming back - try to let this be no more than 10 minutes. Finally, please seek out Liz and she'll show you where you can go to gather yourself. If it's your partner, please try to be understanding - not everyone is able to handle crowds. During this time, make sure you're hydrated, and go over things you've already done. <strong>If your partner is taking a break, don't complete work without them.</strong> They need to be involved in the exercise as much as you do.</p>
        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>Exercises are a large part of the first half of class - they're used to demonstrate concepts talked about in lectures. They also include detailed explanations, and pre-work to be gone over before the exercise is completed. They'll test your ability to solve problems - try to solve them on your own first. If you get stuck, work with your partner, then if you remain stuck, grab one of the instructors. Your average time-to-unstuck should be 20 minutes, so try to use a mix of partners and instructors to keep it there. </p>
        <p>Don't worry about how long you take to complete the exercises, or how fast you go through them compared to other students. You may emerge with a more through understanding than other groups - time to complete is not an indicator of skill. Understanding is an indicator of skill. Take as long as you need to understand what it is you've done.</p>
        <p>Make a plan before you start the exercise - write it down on paper or in a text file. Run through it as the computer, try to determine what it will do before you start figuring out the appropriate syntax. Programming is about making a plan, not memorizing syntax.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>If you haven't looked at this page before, I know you scanned the entire page until you found this subheading. First, go back and read the rest of the guide. I'll wait.</p>
        <p>Great! You're back. So - time spent on your project is half of the class. This <em>might</em> have lead you to believe that it's the most important thing in the class. It's not. It's very important - but interview practice is just as important. You'll wish you spent more time on that at the end of class.</p>
        <p>Other students have worked on projects of varying complexity, to varying degrees of success. People have gone to career day with half-finished projects, or projects that wouldn't work. Some of them are basic webapps, some of them involve Machine Learning. Some of them involve Sentiment Analysis and Part of Speech Processing. Some are Compliers. Some are Database Engines. Some are Data Visualizations. Some are a combination of many of those. Some work better than others, are designed better, are more technically complex. The highest offer doesn't go to the best, hardest, weirdest or most interesting project - it goes to the student who displays the best and broadest technical mastery, and the best attitude about it.</p>
        <p>We recommend you work on something you're interested in. Something that makes you excited to finish, and something you can talk about. Enthusiasm separates candidates from the herd, so ensure your project makes you excited. That said, <strong><em>We are not an accelerator. We aren't an incubator, we aren't here for you to learn to make a product that you can turn into a business.</em></strong> If you are worried about anything other than <em>how to build</em> your project, you need to pick another project. Other considerations will only distract you from learning.</p>
        <p>Also, <strong>We do not recommend you work on a mobile project.</strong> This is because people have unfair expectations about mobile technology. As a junior developer, making something responsive and well-designed enough to look good is nearly impossible. <em>This should not be viewed as a challenge.</em> If you have dreams of being a mobile developer, we can put you in touch with people who can make that happen - but your project is not the time to start. </p>
        <p>Your project should...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be cleared by Christian or Liz</li>
          <li>Demonstrate technical proficiency, not product savvy or design talent</li>
          <li>Be hard enough to frustrate you, and perhaps make you cry once</li>
          <li>Not be so hard that you can't do it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Q:</strong> Can I pair with someone?</li>
          <li><strong>A:</strong> Maybe. Talk to Liz or Christian about your partner and the project you want to work on.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>What about PhoneGap? Can I do that, since it's HTML and JS?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>No.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>Can I do a project someone else has already done in a previous class?</strong></li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Yes - you have to write your own code, but it's great because you'll have someone you can ask questions to.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>Can I use other people's code for my project, and build off of it?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Depends - if it's a module, or code that's designed to be reused, yes. If it's a webapp that you just want to change, no. You need to start from scratch in terms of the architecture of your project.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>What's the best kind of project to work on?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Something you like. Also, something you find interesting. Something you think is just a little bit too hard to do. But not something that's beyond you. Ask multiple instructors for advice.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>My project isn't as complicated as someone else's. Will I look bad next to them?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>No. People need a mix of skills - engineering managers are afraid to hire a team of people who write compilers. Your project and your personality get you an interview - your knowledge gets you an offer.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>I don't like my project anymore/I am really frustrated with my project. Can I switch?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>It's probably a bad idea. We can help you pivot, and we can help you be less frustrated. But to completely change is pretty hard, and will set you back.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>I'm done with my project super early. Am I done with the class?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>No! Now you have to do something more complicated. That's what you get for showing off.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>I just realized I'm not going to be able to finish my project. What do I do?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>It's fine - talk to an instructor about scaling it back, or getting it to a point where you can show somebody something. Even an attempt is fine, as long as you can talk about it.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>Someone offered to buy my project! What do I do?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Well, we're not financial counselors - but it's also likely they're trying to buy you as an engineer. Talk to us about what, why, and don't anticipate this happening. Also, this is an incredibly silly time in Silicon Valley for funding right now, so have a serious sit-down with an instructor before you do anything.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>Will my project make my employer think I only want to do things related to my project?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>It might. Be sure to try to show off a range of skills, or work on something you might be reasonably interested in doing for a few months.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>I don't know what to do next with my project!</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Talk to an instructor.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>How do I pick a project? You said I couldn't do X and I really wanted to!</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Let go if we said not to do it, we said that for a reason. Only then can you love(another project idea) again. And don't just marry the first rebound project that comes your way - talk to us, explore suggestions, talk to your mentor, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>Can my mentor/boyfriend/girlfriend/dog/you/Zed Shaw help with my project?</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Anyone can help - but only you should be the one writing code. Don't let other people commit to your project unless you're going to state they're a contributor. Presenting something as "your" project that isn't yours is going to make potential employers suspicious of your skills. Pairing is fine though, as well as asking for advice, what to do next, help with modeling or whiteboarding or anything else you don't know how to do.</li>
          <li><strong>Q: </strong>My question isn't listed here!</li>
          <li><strong>A: </strong>Just come to the office and ask us. Jeez.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Interview Practice</h2>
        <p>You need to practice for interviews. It's a meta-skill, so you're going to try and fail several times before you get an offer. We'd rather you tried and failed with us, rather than crying in your Google interview. Several things go into interviews usually - learning something on the spot and immediately applying it. Variations on general algorithm implementations. Puzzles, brain teasers, trick questions. Whiteboarding code for people who are kinda mean and socially awkward. Pair programming. Pair programming with someone who is kinda mean and socially awkward. Answering questions to people who have trained at keeping their faces carefully neutral whether not they're massively impressed or completely stupefied by your ignorance. Mortal combat. Immortal combat. Jump/climbing out of a pit like in the 3rd Batman movie. Are you still reading?</p>
        <p>Our mentors and instructors are here to help you, but you'll need to attend the sessions that occur in a very natural unscheduled way. Also, we have many copies of "Cracking the Coding Interview", which we'll run you through as much as possible.</p>
        <h2>Career Day</h2>
        <p>Hackbright career day is a chance for Hackbright partner companies to get to know the students. The day consists of 7-minute lightning-interviews where students have a chance to show off their projects. It's meant to bypass the first round technical phone screen and a bit of the culture-fit consideration, as well keep students from having to submit their resumes to a black hole. Most hiring partners have made offers, and most come back. We'd quote statistics but then I'd have to change this page every time they change.</p>

          <p align="center">The 10-week program is Monday through Friday, from 10am to 6pm.</p>

          <h2>Pre-Work</h2>
          <p>Prior to starting Hackbright, we require students to review the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The Command Line Crash Course: <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/</a></li>
            <li>Learn Python the Hard Way: <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Curriculum</h2>
          <p>The first half of the program goes over computer science principles and practices using the Python language. We cover a number of things not mentioned in this general overview, so each day is very important. We do try to provide material to review in the event that a student misses a day, but each day is crucial.</p>


          <p>We believe in pair programming as a powerful teaching tool. Having another person sitting next to you watching you code can be harrowing, but nothing keeps you focused like a second set of eyes. Pair programming encourages knowledge sharing, rapid brainstorming, and keeps you from checking Facebook too much. Students pair as much as possible during the program.</p>


          <h3>Week One</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Intro to UNIX</li>
            <li>Elementary programming</li>
            <li>Intro to source control</li>
            <li>Intro to coding standards</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The first week starts with a crash course in basic unix operations and utilities. Students are encouraged to stay in the command line as much as possible. They are introduced to basic programming concepts: flow control, data types, and functions. Git and github are introduced, along with the idea of coding guidelines. Students build several command line utilities to practice basic string parsing, including a prefix calculator.</p>

          <h3>Week Two</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Data structures</li>
            <li>File manipulation</li>
            <li>Object oriented programming</li>
            <li>Introduction to algorithms</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Week two introduces more rigorous computer science, exploring the usage of lists and dictionaries for solving different classes of problems. The notion of algorithmic complexity is introduced, and students are asked to analyze their solutions in terms of time and space usage. The python memory model is explained from a high level.</p>


          <p>Exercises center around the consumption of data from file streams and parsing formatted data into native python data structures. Students build a two-dimensional puzzle game to learn about objects and classes. The relative merits of objects versus dictionaries in the concept of python are discussed.</p>


          <p>The elective for the week is introductory HTML and CSS using the open source GDI curriculum.</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Taking time and space complexity further, students explore the difficulties of consuming datasets that are so large as to not fit in working memory. The LogLog algorithm and bloom filters are presented as techniques to deal with large data sets.</p>


          <h3>Week Three</h3>
          <ul> 
            <li>Problem solving with data structures</li>
            <li>Markov chains</li>
            <li>API interaction</li>
            <li>Regular Expressions</li>
            <li>Data modeling, relational databases, and SQL</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Week three focuses on doing useful things with all the tools students have learned until this point. Students use dictionaries to build a Markov text generator and wire it up to Twitter. This is usually a student’s first exposure to external APIs.</p>


          <p>There is a brief interlude involving regular expressions before moving onto data modeling with relational databases. Students build a command-line database application for tracking student grades in a classroom setting.</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Regular expressions are explained in terms of DFAs and NFAs. The Thompson NFA technique for matching regular expressions is explored.</p>

          <h3>Week Four</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Web request/response life cycle</li>
            <li>The Flask web framework</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Trees and the DOM</li>
            <li>Recursive algorithms</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Students finally synthesize all of their tools and techniques into a web-based task list app built on the Flask framework. Code is constantly reviewed for adherence to current best-practices. Students are shown how to do basic sanitization of user form input before processing as a counter to SQL injection attacks.</p>


          <p>The remainder of the week is spent immersed in javascript and its use in manipulating the DOM. The concept of trees are explained and examples besides the DOM are given. Recursion is shown as a technique for traversing trees.</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Recursion is taken a step further with memorization and its use in dynamic programming problems. Students look at traditional combinatorial problems (change counting, path counting) and solve them using dynamic programming.</p>

          <h3>Week Five</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Object-relational mappers</li>
            <li>Web development best practices</li>
            <li>Pearson correlation and prediction</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Students begin to look at the larger picture of an application. Abstraction, regularity in application design and design patterns are introduced. Functional programming and ORMs are used as examples of how to build maintainable applications, and expand your reach as an individual developer. The week is spent on a single long-form movie rating web application. Pearson correlation is used as an introduction to machine learning and prediction as part of the application. Performance vs increasing abstraction is discussed (and how to compromise).</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Students learn basic graph theory. They construct incidence and adjacency matrices for a given tree. They also learn to construct minimum spanning trees and explore what they mean in the context of real graphs (road data, social graph, etc).</p>

          <h3>Week 6 through Week 10</h3>

          <p>Students build an independent project in their favored area of study. In the past, this has ranged from practical web applications to more traditional CS projects, including compiler design and construction. Students are encouraged to work on anything that excites them. Instructors provide guidance and act as product and project managers for the duration of the process.</p>


          <p>Students use this time to hone the skills they've acquired in the first half of the project in preparation for a round of interviews with Hackbright partner companies.</p>
