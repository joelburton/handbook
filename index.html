            <strong>This is probably the most important set of rules we have.</strong> Our community is what makes us successful as a company, and what makes you successful as students. This program is less about memorizing algorithms and much more about learning how, and who, to ask questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is more than a set of rules to follow while you're here. This is meant to be a guide in how to deal with other developers, other students in the "real world", and to remind you that you will always be a student. Programming means never giving up learning, never stopping growth.

            <li>Don't torrent on our connection, our routers can't handle it. Also, please don't set up a Tor exit point on our connection.</li>
            <li>We're an engineering school, please treat our network as "hostile". Students are apt to "experiment" with "security techniques". We aren't responsible for anything that happens to your system on our network, but please ask us if you need help securing your system.</li>

          <h2>Health</h2>
          <p>
            These are things people tend to forget about during Hackbright, and we mean them very seriously. You can't be a great programmer without taking care of yourself.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep. Seriously, you can't not sleep.</li>
            <li>Eat. Real food - make yourself something, or eat some Free Food from the fridge.</li>
            <li>Drink Water. Don't drink soda, don't drink tea or coffee until you've had at least one cup of water. Keep track of it somewhere. Get half your body weight(in lbs) in ounces, per day.</li>
            <li>Caffeine is your friend, but it's not liquid sleep. Seriously, go to sleep.</li>
            <li>If you're sick, don't come in. Be actually sick though, not just overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>If you're overwhelmed, talk to us. We are experts at helping with this feeling, and we want you to get through this.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="span6">
          <h2>Time</h2>
          <p>
            Here's how to best use your time here.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep at night.</li>
            <li>Instructors are here from 10AM to roughly 8PM. If you need help, work with us during that time. Naps during the day might be helpful to you, but you have limited, and expensive, time to get seriously productive 1-on-1 help.</li>
            <li>Pick a project you enjoy working on. Something you'd like to see done, or something you've always wanted to understand. Don't worry if it's useful, or interesting to anyone but you. This is a time to explore what you do and don't like about programming.</li>
            <li>Use your mentor. They've signed up to help someone, and they get benefits by just affiliating themselves with Hackbright. Use their skills and knowledge to understand things.</li>
            <li>Understand your editor. Vim can be really useful, but so can Sublime Text and other IDEs. Pick a tool, then get good at that tool.</li>
            <li>Cheatsheets are something you're going to want to create. No one expects you to memorize anything, and you're wasting time by trying.</li>
            <li>If you get stuck, ask for help. If you aren't making progress because you don't understand, then ask.</li>
            <li>Don't copy-paste and walk away. Programming isn't fire and forget - you need to understand what's going on. If you complete an exercise and you can't explain how you did it, find an instructor.</li>
          </ul>
