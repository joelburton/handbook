            <strong>This is probably the most important set of rules we have.</strong> Our community is what makes us successful as a company, and what makes you successful as students. This program is less about memorizing algorithms and much more about learning how, and who, to ask questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is more than a set of rules to follow while you're here. This is meant to be a guide in how to deal with other developers, other students in the "real world", and to remind you that you will always be a student. Programming means never giving up learning, never stopping growth.

            These are things people tend to forget about during Hackbright, and we mean them very seriously. You can't be a great programmer without taking care of yourself.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep. Seriously, you can't not sleep.</li>
            <li>Eat. Real food - make yourself something, or eat some Free Food from the fridge.</li>
            <li>Drink Water. Don't drink soda, don't drink tea or coffee until you've had at least one cup of water. Keep track of it somewhere. Get half your body weight(in lbs) in ounces, per day.</li>
            <li>Caffeine is your friend, but it's not liquid sleep. Seriously, go to sleep.</li>
            <li>If you're sick, don't come in. Be actually sick though, not just overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>If you're overwhelmed, talk to us. We are experts at helping with this feeling, and we want you to get through this.</li>

          <h2>Time</h2>
          <p>
            Here's how to best use your time here.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sleep at night.</li>
            <li>Instructors are here from 10AM to roughly 8PM. If you need help, work with us during that time. Naps during the day might be helpful to you, but you have limited, and expensive, time to get seriously productive 1-on-1 help.</li>
            <li>Pick a project you enjoy working on. Something you'd like to see done, or something you've always wanted to understand. Don't worry if it's useful, or interesting to anyone but you. This is a time to explore what you do and don't like about programming.</li>
            <li>Use your mentor. They've signed up to help someone, and they get benefits by just affiliating themselves with Hackbright. Use their skills and knowledge to understand things.</li>
            <li>Understand your editor. Vim can be really useful, but so can Sublime Text and other IDEs. Pick a tool, then get good at that tool.</li>
            <li>Cheatsheets are something you're going to want to create. No one expects you to memorize anything, and you're wasting time by trying.</li>
            <li>If you get stuck, ask for help. If you aren't making progress because you don't understand, then ask.</li>
            <li>Don't copy-paste and walk away. Programming isn't fire and forget - you need to understand what's going on. If you complete an exercise and you can't explain how you did it, find an instructor.</li>

          <p align="center">The 10-week program is Monday through Friday, from 10am to 6pm.</p>

          <h2>Pre-Work</h2>
          <p>Prior to starting Hackbright, we require students to review the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The Command Line Crash Course: <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/</a></li>
            <li>Learn Python the Hard Way: <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Curriculum</h2>
          <p>The first half of the program includes an accelerated in-depth teaching of the Python language, then covers the elements of a modern web application stack with guided projects. For the remainder of the program, students work on projects they’re passionate about. We bring in guests from great companies and have talks and breakout sessions exposing students to as many sub-disciplines as we can manage. We also match the students with experienced software engineers who serve as mentors, and visit Silicon Valley companies on field trips.</p>


          <p>We believe in pair programming as a powerful teaching tool. Having another person sitting next to you watching you code can be harrowing, but nothing keeps you focused like a second set of eyes. Pair programming encourages knowledge sharing, rapid brainstorming, and keeps you from checking Facebook too much. Students pair as much as possible during the program.</p>


          <p>There is a standard curriculum, but if students show aptitude for more advanced concepts, there are additional exercises that build on the exercises of the week.</p>

          <h3>Week One</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Intro to UNIX</li>
            <li>Elementary programming</li>
            <li>Intro to source control</li>
            <li>Intro to coding standards</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The first week starts with a crash course in basic unix operations and utilities. Students are encouraged to stay in the command line as much as possible. They are introduced to basic programming concepts: flow control, data types, and functions. Git and github are introduced, along with the idea of coding guidelines. Students build several command line utilities to practice basic string parsing, including a prefix calculator.</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Students extend the prefix calculator to allow for storage and recall from variables. More commands are added to the calculator and a simple scripting language is built.</p>

          <h3>Week Two</h3>
          Data structures
          File manipulation
          Object oriented programming
          Introduction to algorithms
          HTML and CSS

          <p>Week two introduces more rigorous computer science, exploring the usage of lists and dictionaries for solving different classes of problems. The notion of algorithmic complexity is introduced, and students are asked to analyze their solutions in terms of time and space usage. The python memory model is explained from a high level.</p>


          <p>Exercises center around the consumption of data from file streams and parsing formatted data into native python data structures. Students build a two-dimensional puzzle game to learn about objects and classes. The relative merits of objects versus dictionaries in the concept of python are discussed.</p>


          <p>The elective for the week is introductory HTML and CSS using the open source GDI curriculum.</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Taking time and space complexity further, students explore the difficulties of consuming datasets that are so large as to not fit in working memory. The LogLog algorithm and bloom filters are presented as techniques to deal with large data sets.</p>


          <h3>Week Three</h3>
          Problem solving with data structures
          Markov chains
          API interaction
          Regular Expressions
          Data modeling, relational databases, and SQL

          <p>Week three focuses on doing useful things with all the tools students have learned until this point. Students use dictionaries to build a markov text generator and wire it up to Twitter. This is usually a student’s first exposure to external APIs.</p>


          <p>There is a brief interlude involving regular expressions before moving onto data modeling with relational databases. Students build a command-line database application for tracking student grades in a classroom setting.</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Regular expressions are explained in terms of DFAs and NFAs. The Thompson NFA technique for matching regular expressions is explored.</p>

          <h3>Week Four</h3>
          Web request/response life cycle
          The Flask web framework
          Javascript
          Trees and the DOM
          Recursive algorithms

          <p>Students finally synthesize all of their tools and techniques into a web-based task list app built on the Flask framework. Code is constantly reviewed for adherence to current best-practices. Students are shown how to do basic sanitization of user form input before processing as a counter to SQL injection attacks.</p>


          <p>The remainder of the week is spent immersed in javascript and its use in manipulating the DOM. The concept of trees are explained and examples besides the DOM are given. Recursion is shown as a technique for traversing trees.</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Recursion is taken a step further with memorization and its use in dynamic programming problems. Students look at traditional combinatorial problems (change counting, path counting) and solve them using dynamic programming.</p>

          <h3>Week Five</h3>
          Object-relational mappers
          Web development best practices
          Pearson correlation and prediction

          <p>Students begin to look at the larger picture of an application. Abstraction, regularity in application design and design patterns are introduced. Functional programming and ORMs are used as examples of how to build maintainable applications, and expand your reach as an individual developer. The week is spent on a single long-form movie rating web application. Pearson correlation is used as an introduction to machine learning and prediction as part of the application. Performance vs increasing abstraction is discussed (and how to compromise).</p>


          <p><em>Advanced</em>: Students learn basic graph theory. They construct incidence and adjacency matrices for a given tree. They also learn to construct minimum spanning trees and explore what they mean in the context of real graphs (road data, social graph, etc).</p>

          <h3>Week 6 through Week 10</h3>

          <p>Students build an independent project in their favored area of study. In the past, this has ranged from practical web applications to more traditional CS projects, including compiler design and construction. Students are encouraged to work on anything that excites them. Instructors provide guidance and act as product and project managers for the duration of the process.</p>


          <p>Students use this time to hone the skills they’ve acquired in the first half of the project in preparation for a round of interviews with Hackbright partner companies.</p>
